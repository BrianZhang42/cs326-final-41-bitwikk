<h2>Innovative Idea</h2>
Our team's web application will be a wiki made to document and share information about retro games. While separate wikis exist for specific games, at the moment there are no major websites that properly document details surrounding older games and their history. 

We plan on scraping various archives and websites to generate content for our web pages. There are many retro game archives that host scans of magazines, box covers, instruction manuals, etc. This would just be to populate our wiki initially, and users would be able to edit the content afterwards.

<h2>Important Components</h2>
Users would be able to edit pages for games, game systems, and the like, as well as post comments below the main article to discuss the page content with one another.

When users edit pages, they can change the text, and add new subsections or pictures.
